## Abstracts

CIFAR-100 is a computer vision data set used for object recognition. This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 pixel color images distributed in 100 classes of objects follow by 20 superclass , with 600 images per class, these are:

| Superclass                    |      Classes                                        |

Of this total of 60,000 images, 50,000 are for training and 10,000 for testing. For this specific project, 10% of training images were removed to validate, leaving the data distribution as follows:
<img src="./images/Image1.jpeg" />

The purpose of this project is to recognize an image and predict which of the 100 CIFAR-100 classes it belongs to by mainly using Logistic Regression with Neural Net

The following model are used in this project

- Logistic Regression (1 and 2 layer with neural net)
- CNN (VGG)

## The Data Set

There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a "fine" label (the class to which it belongs) and a "coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs).

<img src="./images/Image2.png" />

The dimension of a color image is 32x32 pixels and is made up of 3 channels (Red, Green, Blue = RGB) for each pixel present in them. The values for each channel range from 0 to 255, allowing each pixel in the image to be colored. Considering the above, you have 32 x 32 x 3 = 3072 data per image.
